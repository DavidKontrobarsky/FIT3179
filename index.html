               What affects the outcome of political protests? This visualisation looks at multiple dimensions of political protests including location, number of protesters and duration of protests to identify some trends in how states react to mass mobilisation of its citizens. Here's what I found. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Firstly we can look at the geographical location of protests around the world as well as their participant numbers and duration. There is a clear protest hotspot in Europe but particularly around Eastern Europe where some long lasting protests occured. You can hover over each of the protests to find out more. 
            </p>
            
            <div id="vis1"></div>
            
            <p>
                Now that we have a general understanding of protest geography, it's time to look more deeply into how countries respond to protests and how protest sentiment has changed over time. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
               We can clearly see that the vast majority of protests are either ignored or crowds are dispersed. There is some variation of over time as well. For example, between 2003 and 2011, there was a decrease in protests being and ignored and an increase in protest crowds being dispersed. Overall we can see that protests are hardly ever succesfull as protest demands are accomodated only around 5 to 10% of the time. 
            </p>
            <div id="vis4"></div>
            
            <p>
               We would also expect different countries to respond in different ways to protests. The next 2 graphs demonstrate the 2 extremes of the states response to protests i.e the most violent responses and the most lenient responses. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
               In these bar charts, the stacks are ordered from the most lenient state response (Accomodation) to most violent (Killings) and the countries are chosen by the proportion of protests that result in killings, shootings or beatings. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Yemen is the country that reacts most violently, where around 30% of all protests have ended in either Beatings, Shootings or Killings. 
            </p>
            
            <div id="vis2"></div>
            
            <p>
                On the other the hand, the next set of countries are the most accomodating to protests. Suprisingly, the most accomodating country is Liberia where more than 20% of total protests have resulted in protester demands being accomodated. This is a very high proportion.  We can also see that the prevalence of beatings, killings and shootings is very low for these countries e.g more than 80% of protests do not involve violence. 
            </p>
            
            
            <div id="vis3"></div>
            <p>
                It will also be interesting to see whether the number of participants and protest duration has any effect on the outcome of the protest.  
            </p>

                It will also be interesting to see whether the number of participants and protest duration has any effect on the outcome of the protest.

            <p>
                There are a few insights to be gained from the heatmap below. Firstly, it appears that in general that the largest protests in regards to the number of protesters tend to last the longest in duration. You can tell this from the rectangles in the 5000-10000 and >10000 columns being darker than the others. Also, it looks like long protests with a large number of participants were most likely to result in beatings and arrests. This is interesting to see.
